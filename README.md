- **Pagination & Filtering**: Efficient data access with paginated responses and filters.
- **Error Handling**: Clear, structured responses for errors.

## Technology Stack

- **Java 11+**
- **Spring Boot** for REST API development
- **MySQL** for data persistence
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **JUnit** for unit testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Java 11 or later
- Maven 3.6 or later
- MySQL or a compatible SQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   cd job-company-Api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

3. Configure database settings in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/job_company_db

   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. The API should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
